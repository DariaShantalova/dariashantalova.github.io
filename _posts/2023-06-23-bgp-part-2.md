# BGP Part 2
## Scalability Mechanisms
### Private AS
16 bit number 65536
Private range [64512;65535]
Extension - 32bit number
Private range [4200000000; 4294967294]

### Peer Groups
* for smaller configuration file
* for performance improvement

Neighbor inherit all of the peer-group staff and we even can give neighbor specific configuration, that peer group doesn't have.
Configuration for peer group and then add neighbor to peer group

### Dynamic Update Peer-Groups
Can be splited into two parts; Dynamic Update Peer-Groups are more efficeent then peer groups. And exclude each other (you can't have both)
Inheretance approach
* Session Templates
* Policy Templates

### Session Templates
Anything relevant to the session
    timers; remote-as; update-source; ebgp-miltihop
```
template peer-session MYNAME
     inherit peer-session MYOTHERNAME
     remote-as 100
     update-source 100
     exit-peer-session
 neighbor <ip address> inherit peer-session MYNAME
```

### Policy Templates
Anything relevant to policy
   next-hop-self, distribute list, filter-list, route-map
Inheritense is more flexible - inherit from up to 7 templates directly
```
template peer-policy MYNAME
     inherit peer-policy MYOTHERNAME
     next-hop-self
     route-map MYMAP out
     exit-peer-policy
 neighbor <ip address> inherit peer-policy MYNAME
```

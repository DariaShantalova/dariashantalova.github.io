# BGP Part 2
## Scalability Mechanisms
### Private AS
16 bit number 65536
Private range [64512;65535]
Extension - 32bit number
Private range [4200000000; 4294967294]

### Peer Groups
* for smaller configuration file
* for performance improvement

Neighbor inherit all of the peer-group staff and we even can give neighbor specific configuration, that peer group doesn't have.
Configuration for peer group and then add neighbor to peer group

### Dynamic Update Peer-Groups
Can be splited into two parts; Dynamic Update Peer-Groups are more efficeent then peer groups. And exclude each other (you can't have both)
Inheretance approach
* Session Templates
* Policy Templates

### Session Templates
Anything relevant to the session
    timers; remote-as; update-source; ebgp-miltihop
```
template peer-session MYNAME
     inherit peer-session MYOTHERNAME
     remote-as 100
     update-source 100
     exit-peer-session
 neighbor <ip address> inherit peer-session MYNAME
```

### Policy Templates
Anything relevant to policy
   next-hop-self, distribute list, filter-list, route-map
Inheritense is more flexible - inherit from up to 7 templates directly
```
template peer-policy MYNAME
     inherit peer-policy MYOTHERNAME
     next-hop-self
     route-map MYMAP out
     exit-peer-policy
 neighbor <ip address> inherit peer-policy MYNAME
```

### iBGP Scalability Issues
* iBGP split horizon (we will not advertise prefix that we get from iBGP)
* full-mesh for NH reachability, if we have many devices, it will make impact on perfomence


### Route Reflectors
All devices consists in a cluster; there is 32bit cluster id on a route reflector; 
Other device RR Clients are completly unaware of configuration. Everything is done on RR, including 32 bit clustet id.
The best practice for the cluster id is to pull it from a Router Id of RR.

Prefix advertisement that comes from route reflector client, RR will flood it to RR peers and it also sends it to it's non RRC peers. Update from R4 will be available on the other devices and we don't have full mesh :)

If non RR client will send an update, the RR will sent it to RR clients, but it will follow iBBP rule and will not send update to other iBGP non RR client. So we will need to have a peering beetween R1 and R2.

Configuration command:
```
neighbor <ip> route-reflector-client
```

### Advanced Route Reflector Designs
The previous chapter showed one point failure. So we create second RR. There will be 2 clusters with 2 clusters id.

Another design is nested RR , but it can create loops (inter and intra, as RRC have no idea they in cluster, and if two RRC have peering session, loop can appear. So attributes Cluster_List and ORIG_id are used.

### Confederations
Inside AS there are several private AS. 
And now we manipulating eBGP behavior, as we now have confederation eBGP peerings.
They are not gonna follow to same rules as a standart eBGP. For outside world this would look like AS100.
Next Hop behavior have to change. 
* Next Hop doesn't change.
* Local Preference is going to be maintained.
* The MED is going to be passed between confederations.

For loop prevention 2 new attributes are creates:
* AS_CONFED_SEQ
* AS_CONFED_SET

# Ansible
<https://docs.ansible.com/>
Ansible host to connect should have:
* Python interpreter
* SSH enabled
* ansible can be installed on several hosts
* playbook executed from controller host


To execute an Ansible playbook in the most basic way, you will need two main files, the inventory and the playbook, as mentioned.
```
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbookfile.yml
```
The ansible-playbook program and command line utility are used to execute the playbook.
First, you will enter the ansible-playbook command, and use the (-i) flag to tell Ansible what inventory file to use.
Note
There are options so you are not required to use (-i) to specify an inventory file.

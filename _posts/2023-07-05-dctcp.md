# DCTCP (Data Center TCP)
requires modification of 3 components: sender, receiver and device in the middle
## DCTCP algorithm
* switch detects congestion -> set CE codepoint in IP header
* receiver sends to sender ECN- echo
* sender reduce TCP congestion window

## Congestion Threshold
Packet arrives, the queue length > threshold -> switch use CE codepoint
  formula depends on switch realization
  K > (RTT * C) > 7 , C - link rate packets per sec

## EC Echo and CWP - Congestion Window Reduced
receiver will send tcp segments with ECE flag until it gets CWR

(*picture was taken form here <https://slideplayer.com/slide/9447501/>*)

## DCTCP variable - DCTCP.CE
* initialized as false
* stored in TCB (Transmission Block)

### Algorithm (while DCTCP.CE is unchanged, the receiver sends normal delayed ACK)
  * if receiver gets CE codepoint is set and DCTCP.CE = false -> set DCTCP = true, send ack
  * if receiver gets packet without CE code point and DCTCP.CE = true -> set DCTP = false, send ack
  * otherwile ignore CE codepoint

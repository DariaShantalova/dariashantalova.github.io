 # BGP
 - Only EGP in major use today.
 - Point-to-Poing Peering
 - Application Level Protocol
 - TCP (179)
 - Path Vector (not metric)
 
## BGP Path Attributes
* Well-Known, Mandatory (mandatory by RFC4271, will be included in every update)  
   * AS-Path
   * Next-Hop
   * Origin
Can be incomplete
* Well-Known, Discretionary (well-known: means industry standart, every router supports this attributes; Discretionary: means I am allowed not to use them; if I use then -> I pass them)
   * Local Preference
   * Atomic Aggregate
* Optional, Transitive (Optional: if you design software, you option add or not to add this attribute, you can also add proprietary attribute; Transitive: the attribute will be passed to another router)
   * Aggregator
   * Community 
* Optional, Non-Transitive
   * MED (Metric)
   * Originator ID
   * Cluster

\#show ip bgp <network>


Loop Prevention Mechanism: AS-PATH
Let the loop, as soon as it's duplicated AS - the route will be dropped.
 
 ### The Origin Attribute (well-known, mandatory)
 - attemt to record where from that prefic come from
* i - IGP (network command, 
* e - EGP
* ? - incomplete 
 
 
### The next-hop attribute (AS to AS, instead of router to touter logic)
 If next hop is unreachable, best past selection algorithm will not be applyed
Is not changed inside iBGP, can result that we will not have route to the next-hop inside iBGP.
 solution:
 On edge iBGP router set: neighbor <ip address> next-hop-self
 
 ### BGP Weight (Specific to Cisco)
 A number from 0 to 65 535
 The higher vlaue - the higher preference
Only on the router, information is not passed to any other router 
When a prefix is locally generated it will get value 32 768 weight, otherwise (if not locally generated) the default value is 0.
 
 ex: a router have route to the prefix through 2 different as, you'll need just to choose a higher weight value

## BGP Neighbors
There are 2 types of neighbors
* EBGP
 (between diffent AS)
* iBGP
 (between the same AS, if there is a need to distribute some routes in our network from internet)
 
 TCP - 179
 Simple communications:
 * OPEN - starts the session
 * KEEPALIVE - maintains the session (doesn't rely on tcp)
 * UPDATE - take some time, cause lot's updates are on the internet, shouldn't react immediately
 * NOTIFICATION - smth is broken, before to break the session
 * (Route Refresh - not in the original standart, updating routes without affecting peering)

 
 Neighbor can be not directly connected, can have neighbors on top of other routers.
 The more specific route beats everything.
 By getting some routes from iBGP we can choose more specific route.
 
 Before creating neighborship, you put all kind of filters, so the neighbor will not mess your routes. Same from other side.
 
 ## BGP Header
* Marker field - deprecated, field with all 1, was made fore synchronization beetwen peers and authentication, still there if there is an old bgp device
* Length
* Type - indicates of what type of bgp message we are dealing with
** 1 - open
** 2 - update
** 3 - notification
** 4 - keepalive
** 5 - route refresh behavior

  ##  BGP Neighbor Relationship Process (6 states)
 * Idle (neighbor configured, if stuck in idle chances are good that they can't reach each other, all roads lead to idle)
 * Connect ( trying to form TCP relationship, to check #show tcp br)
 * Active (also tcp)
 * OpenSent (BGP version, autonomous system is correct? , router id, passwords)
 * OpenConfirm (the open message comes back)
 * Established, number - represents how many prefixes it receives from other side, neighbor established
 
 to check \#show ip bgp summary


 ## BGP Best Path Algorithm , CISCO, BGP Decision path
Attributes
1. WEIGTH (Cisco Proprietary) - higher is better (example if route comes from big net, I want to put higher weight on this route then from the smaller net, using route map) , as it's chosen, will not look to other part of the list
2. Local Prefenrence - somethimg that travels through yours autonomous system
3. Locally Originated
4. Accumulated IGP (AIGP) - can take the metric of interior protocol
5. Shortest AS-PATH

## BGP network command
create ip route in ip route table, the classfull mask will be used
   ```
    int lo0
      ip address 1.1.1.1 255.0.0.0
   router bgp <AS>
   network 1.0.0.0
```
example without classfull mask
   ```
   int lo1
      ip address 11.11.11.1 255.255.255.0
   router bgp <AS>
   network 1.1.1.0 mask 255.255.255.0
```
to check result, AD for eBGP (CISCO) is showed 20: 
```
   show ip bgp
```

## BGP NLRI redistribution
In case of a redistribution the origin attribute value will be '?'
Example redistributing routes from eigrp
```
   router bgp <AS>
   redistribute eigrp <id>
```

## BGP RIB Failure
Example: if we have same route from EIGRP and eBGP, route will be marked as 'r - RIB failure' in bgp table and will not be transfered to routing table
to check the reason of the mark 'r - RIB failure' 
```
show ip bgp rib-failure
```
To cancel propagation of inactive prefix the command:
```
   router bgp <AS>
   bgp supress-inactive
```

## BGP Synchronyzation (History)
Cisco automatically will generate commands
```
router bgp <AS>
  no synchronyzation
  bgp log-neighbor-changes
  no auto-summary
```
Syncronyzation rule:
BGP speaker will not install prefix into the BGP table or advertise the prefix if there is no synchronizayion beetween IGP protocol and BGP.

No is not used, as we can use full mesh or RR.

# BGP Juniper NLRI Advertisement
To check peerings
```
show bgp summary
```
check if we receive any bgp prefixes
```
show route protocol bgp
```
Juniper approach is policy based, set route from lo0.0 and 
```
edit
edit policy-options policy-statement <NAME>
set term 1 from interface lo0.0
set term 1 then accept
```
```
show
term 1 {
    from interface lo0.0
    then accept;
}
```
tying to bgp config
```
top
set protocols bgp group EXTERNAL export BGPADV
```
```
edit protocols bgp
show
group EXTERNAL {
  type external;
  export BGPADV;
  peer-as 65111;
  neighbor 10.12.12.1
}
```

### Using  static routes in a multi-homed environment
If we have several provides and use static route to them it can cause
* inefficency ( wrong provider choosing, non-optimal routing
* assimetrics and etc.

### iBGP

We have two routes here from R8. But traffic will go only through one, as all attrubutes are equel, but R2 has smaller router-id.

<img width="720" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-22 at 19 01 45" src="https://github.com/DariaShantalova/dariashantalova.github.io/assets/34622678/ce4a872a-8009-4709-89ee-1b2233982331">

### Advertising default route from R2
```
router bgp <as>
  neighbor 10.26.26.6 default-originate
```

## Aggregation: aggregate-address, summary-only, as-set
The first way to aggregate: static route to null and network command; the second is on screenshots
<img width="687" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-22 at 20 03 09" src="https://github.com/DariaShantalova/dariashantalova.github.io/assets/34622678/4a33fff1-f623-4882-bd8c-2bacf8943934">

If we're doing aggregation on R2 without AS set for the networks on R1, then AS300 will be lost. For keeping we have 'as-set' option.


# CISCO BGP Routing Policy Mechanism
RIB consists of 3 parts
1. Adj-RIB-IN
2. Local-RIB
3. Adj-RIB-OUT
 Can set incoming policy to prevent stuff from showing in table 1.
And you can create an out policy to stop stuff from sending out.
Record in Adj-RIB-IN we will consider as candidate prefixes to Local-RIB. They are updates that made up through our policy and gonna be analyzed for inclusion in Local-RIB.
Once the are in Local-RIB, the will be considered for advertising.

This happens through 3 phases:
1. Degree of preference. Candidates are analyzed, example: if we have prefix from BGP and route in RIB from IGP, toute from BGP will not be inserted into RIB.
2. Once they are analyzed, we will have best route injection and loop prevention in RIB.
3. Routes are added and aggregation perform.

   BGP Best Path Selection Algorith is between Phase 1 and 2.


   Commands to check:
 ```
   show ip bgp
   show ip route
   show ip bgp neighbors <neighbor> advertised-route
debug ip routing
```

```
R6
route-map RM-ORIGIN permit 10
set origin incomplete
```
We will be poisoning prefixes by this map. As incomplete attribute is worse then i,e.
```
router bgp 200
neighbot 10.26.26.2 route-map RM-origin in
```
All prefixes received from this neighbor will be poisoned.
In R8 all prefixes will be removed and we will have second path through R7 available.

### InQ and OutQ
Adj-RIB-IN ans Adj-RIB-OUT are not the physical tables that can be checked. Instead Cisco implements it's behavior as InQ and Out Q. 
If we see numbers there means that smth has gone wrong and there is instability in Bgp infrastracture.

### BGP Processes
```
show processes cpu | include BGP
```
* Scheduler
* Router
* I/O
* Scanner

  BGP I/O is responsible for moving prefixes into the Queu and out of the Queu.
  BGP Router - policy, best path decision and etc.
  BGP Scanner - changes: prefixes becomes unreacheble and need to be removed. Also validated prefixes in case of network commans or redistibute command.

  ### Other BGP processes
  Depending on software or vendor there can be other bgp processes, that are unique.
  BMP server, event
  BGP BMP server stands for BGP Monitor Server Protocol. Monitoring of neighborship.
  NHT (Next Hop Tracker Service)
  Event - responds to things like new network state or a new redistribute state.
  Import Scanner - assists scanning process with things like labels, MPLS type environment.
  Open - process when we establish new peering.


  ### Table Version Concepts
If we are running show ip bgp table, there is gonna be main BGP table version and routing table version.
If there is an update, the version is incremented.
We've the prefix to the router, the version of the bgp table has been increased.
Critical number for the syncronyzation of the structures: bgp table and routing table.
Also show how stable is bgp environment.

We can see version of the table for specific prefix entry.

### Clear BGP session (Don't do it in production)
If we create policy and neighborship has already been established, the policy will not be applyed. 

```
clear ip bgp ?
```

### Soft Reconfiguration

```
neighbor <neig> soft-reconfiguration inbound
or if any changes after first command in policy: 
clear ip bgp <neighbor> soft in
```
For outboung soft reconfiguration we don't have to any neighbor manipulation,
Soft recongiguration if we are doing it inbound we are creating little database
of adjecencies in there and we are going to be consuming memmory in order to do it on the device.
And this memmory consumption can be pretty ginomous. So Cisco wanted to implement it the way it wouldn't take so much memmory.
And this capabilities called route resresh.

### Using Cisco vIRL AutoNetKit
To enter pre-configurations into a topology

### Route Refresh
Only necessery one command, some device can not support route refresh though, that's why we went through soft reconfiguration. 
```
clear ip bgp <neighbor> soft in
```

### Using Distribute list
R1 gets from R2 3 prefixes.
<img width="746" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-23 at 14 22 15" src="https://github.com/DariaShantalova/dariashantalova.github.io/assets/34622678/93441469-0209-471b-8a37-af98f6f536df">
We want to get only one prefix. Ditribute list uses access list.

```
conf t
access-list 1 permit 192.168.0.2 0.0.0.0
router bgp 1
address-family ipv4
neighbor 192.168.0.2 ditribute-list in
exit
clear ip bgp 192.168.0.2 soft in
```
<img width="748" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-23 at 14 30 07" src="https://github.com/DariaShantalova/dariashantalova.github.io/assets/34622678/63208b6e-a7b7-404d-9597-fc5e75504d63">

### Extending access-liss
Previously
<img width="831" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-23 at 14 43 37" src="https://github.com/DariaShantalova/dariashantalova.github.io/assets/34622678/95a69045-276a-4ff6-8a63-f184d058fa81">

All the same as in previous chapter
If the prefix begins exactly 100.100 and if the prefix list is 16 bits or greater, we will permit the entry
```
access list 100 permit ip 100.100.0.0 0.0.255.255 255.255.0.0 0.0.255.255
```
<img width="845" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-23 at 14 40 37" src="https://github.com/DariaShantalova/dariashantalova.github.io/assets/34622678/8faa2008-7190-4164-b68c-e01f8bfd0458">


### Prefix List
Create a prefix list named MYLIST that permits 100.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 and masks that are 24 bits or longer.
```
ip prefix-list MYLIST permit 100.0.0.0/8 ge 24
router bgp 1
address-family ipv4
neighbor 192.168.0.2 prefix-list MYLIST in
clear ip bgp * soft
```
next example: accept all except 192.168.0.2/32 prefix
<img width="806" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-23 at 14 54 41" src="https://github.com/DariaShantalova/dariashantalova.github.io/assets/34622678/078e3607-b07b-4090-a84e-5dda8abe8cf7">

### AS_PATH
The logic in AS_PATH is regular expression
```
^ start of string
$ end of string
[] range of characters
- used to specify range
() logical grouping
. any single character
* zero or more instances
+ one or more instances
? zero or more instances
_ coma, open or close brace, start or end of string, or space
```
Examples
```
.* anything
^$ locally originates routes (no as, empty
^100_ learning from AS100
_100$  originated in AS100
_100_       any instane of AS100
       directly connected as
^[0-9]+$
```

Deny evrything originated from As 300, else permit
```
conf t
ip access-path list <1-500> deny _300$
ip access-path list <1-500> permit .*
router bgp <as>
neighbor <neig> filter-list 1 in
clear ip bgp * soft
```

 # BGP
## BGP Path Attributes
* Well-Known, Mandatory (mandatory by RFC4271, will be included in every update)  
   * AS-Path
   * Next-Hop
   * Origin
Can be incomplete
* Well-Known, Discretionary (well-known: means industry standart, every router supports this attributes; Discretionary: means I am allowed not to use them; if I use then -> I pass them)
   * Local Preference
   * Atomic Aggregate
* Optional, Transitive (Optional: if you design software, you option add or not to add this attribute, you can also add proprietary attribute; Transitive: the attribute will be passed to another router)
   * Aggregator
   * Community 
* Optional, Non-Transitive
   * MED (Metric)
   * Originator ID
   * Cluster


Loop Prevention Mechanism: AS-PATH
Let the loop, as soon as it's duplicated AS - the route will be dropped.


## BGP Neighbors
There are 2 types of neighbors
* EBGP
 (between diffent AS)
* iBGP
 (between the same AS, if there is a need to distribute some routes in our network from internet)
 
 TCP - 179
 Simple communications:
 * OPEN - starts the session
 * KEEPALIVE - maintains the session (doesn't rely on tcp)
 * UPDATE - take some time, cause lot's updates are on the internet, shouldn't react immediately
 * NOTIFICATION - smth is broken, before to break the session

 
 Neighbor can be not directly connected, can have neighbors on top of other routers.
 The more specific route beats everything.
 By getting some routes from iBGP we can choose more specific route.
 
 Before creating neighborship, you put all kind of filters, so the neighbor will not mess your routes. Same from other side.
